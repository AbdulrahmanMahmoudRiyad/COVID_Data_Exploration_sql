# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

## Overview

This project involves exploring COVID-19 data using SQL. The primary objectives are to analyze infection rates, death counts, and vaccination progress across various locations and continents. The SQL queries demonstrate skills in data manipulation, including joins, CTEs, temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and data type conversions.

## Datasets

- **CovidDeaths.xlsx**: Contains data on COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- **CovidVaccinations.xlsx**: Contains data on COVID-19 vaccinations.

## SQL Skills Utilized

- Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temporary Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Creating Views
- Data Type Conversions
